Project Features:

1. Arbitrage Strategies:
   - Grid Trading:
     Executes buy and sell orders at predefined price levels to generate profit.
     Implemented in `grid_trading.py`.
   - Statistical Arbitrage:
     Analyzes price differences between two trading pairs and executes trades based on thresholds.
     Implemented in `statistical_arbitrage.py`.

2. WebSocket Listeners:
   - Binance WebSocket:
     Fetches real-time price data from Binance.
     Implemented in `binance_websocket.py`.
   - KuCoin WebSocket:
     Fetches real-time price data from KuCoin.
     Implemented in `kucoin_websocket.py`.

3. Dashboard (Web Interface):
   - Built with FastAPI to display real-time trade history and opportunities.
   - Uses WebSocket for live updates.
   - Implemented in `dashboard.py`.

4. Machine Learning Models:
   - RandomForestRegressor:
     Used for price prediction.
     Implemented in `ml_model.py` and `lstm_model.py`.
   - Technical Indicators:
     Calculates RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and other indicators for analysis.

5. Balance Management:
   - Fetches and displays positive balances from Binance and KuCoin accounts.
   - Implemented in `bakiye.py`.

6. Logging and Error Handling:
   - Logs errors and events in `binance_websocket.log` and `kucoin_websocket.log`.
   - Automatically restarts tasks in case of errors.

7. Test Modules:
   - Includes test scripts for Binance and KuCoin WebSocket connections.
   - Implemented in `test_websocket.py` and `test_kucoin_websocket.py`.

8. Environment Variables:
   - API keys and sensitive information are stored in a `.env` file for security.
   - The `.env` file is excluded from version control using `.gitignore`.

9. Dynamic Risk Management:
   - Calculates trade size and risk percentage dynamically based on market conditions.

10. Trade Execution:
    - Simulates or executes real trades based on the TEST_MODE flag.
    - Includes stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.

11. Log Trades:
    - Saves executed trades to a CSV file for future analysis.

12. Triangular Arbitrage Analyzer:
    - Detects triangular arbitrage opportunities within the same exchange.
    - Uses technical indicators like RSI and MACD for confirmation.
